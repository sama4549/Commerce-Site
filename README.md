# Commerce-Site
This is a project used to practice my ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a commerce website.
No APIs or libraries. Simply pure HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features include: 
  1) Login Feature
  2) Local storage will allow you to create an account and your computer will remember your login info for a later date.
  3) Add selected items to your cart and view the total cost at the checkout page.
  4) Removing items will update the total cost.
  5) Change between users and see that your cart items will be saved when you return to your original account.
